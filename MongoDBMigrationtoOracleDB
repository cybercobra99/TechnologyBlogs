Hello everyone üëã,

In today‚Äôs data-driven world, many organizations start their journey with NoSQL databases like MongoDB because of their flexibility and ease of use. But as the system grows, requirements often shift toward enterprise-grade databases that provide stronger consistency, advanced security, and powerful analytics. That‚Äôs where Oracle Database 19c comes in.

In this article, I‚Äôll walk you through the why and the how of migrating from MongoDB to Oracle Database 19c ‚Äî based on my own hands-on experience.

Why Migrate from MongoDB to Oracle 19c?

Data Consistency & Reliability ‚Üí Oracle provides full ACID compliance, ensuring mission-critical data remains safe and reliable.

Enterprise Features ‚Üí Advanced security, high availability (Data Guard), and performance tuning.

Analytics Power ‚Üí SQL, PL/SQL, and Oracle‚Äôs ecosystem are unmatched when you need deep data insights.

Integration ‚Üí Oracle integrates well with ERP, CRM, and other enterprise apps.

In short, Oracle 19c is not just a database ‚Äî it‚Äôs a full data platform.

Migration Approach

There‚Äôs no ‚Äúone-size-fits-all‚Äù strategy, but here‚Äôs a simple approach you can start with:

1. Assessment & Planning

Identify MongoDB collections and their schema.

Decide which collections map to which Oracle tables.

Note data types ‚Äî for example, ObjectId in MongoDB can be mapped to VARCHAR2 or RAW in Oracle.

2. Export Data from MongoDB

You can use mongoexport to dump collections into JSON or CSV.
